# WorkflowProject
1- https://www.jbpm.org (an open source workflow engine that we can use) and they have plug-in for eclipse to draw the worklfow that we need and this is to get the eclipse plugin
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jbpm5/jbpm5_eclipse_plugin.htm

2- we can use this application http://gojs.net/latest/samples/flowchart.html to be integrated with the JBPM (to have the same xml format of JBPM ) so we will have the integration and we will be able to design the workflow from the web instead of eclipse.
also this is an open source and this the Git link (in my opinion it is a nice interface so our client will love it)
